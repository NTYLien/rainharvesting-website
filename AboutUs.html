        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Rainwater harvesting is the technique of collection and storage of rain into natural reservoirs, tanks, cisterns and other natural and artificial storage units. Rainwater harvesting is also related to the proper management and possible storage of stormwater, which is precipitation from rain and snowmelt events which flows over land (both impervious and pervious surfaces), to advance the infiltration and deceleration of surface water into subsurface aquifers (before it is lost as surface runoff). Rainwater harvesting will improve the stability and quality of local water supply, contributes to sustainable stormwater management, reduces potable water used for food production and irrigation, and can promote other sustainable development goals.</p>
